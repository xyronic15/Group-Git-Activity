Story Time

Years and years of eating muffins left him as nothing more than a hollow shell of a man.
Disappointed with life, the Muffin Man decided now is the time to die.
So, he hopped aboard the coffin train (still covered in muffins, of course) and had himself carried
off to the graveyard, where he asked the coffin bearer for the check.
